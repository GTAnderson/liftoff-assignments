# Project Outline
For this assignment, you will submit a high-level outline of your project. This can, and likely will, change over time. In particular, your mentor will provide direction and feedback to help sharpen your ideas. So don't worry if you feel unsure about some aspects of the outline or if you have to change some things later.

## Submission Instructions

### Overview
My project will be a meal prep planner that will allow users to create individual weekly menu plans. It will allow users to log in, and to create, edit and save menu details such as date/time, title, description, ingredients and nutrition information.

There are many diet apps on the marketplace for tracking information in the past, but this project was motivated by my personal need for a way to prepare meals in advance for time saving and budgeting purposes.
### Features
User login: Users will be able to log in by creating accounts in the system in order to save and update information. Access to the site will be available to guest users with functionality limited to real-time information only (no saved items).

Create and edit menu information: Users will be able to create new menu entries in the system by entering in a mixture of required (title, description, ingredients) and optional fields (date/time and nutrition information).

View saved items: Non-guest users will be able to view a listing of menu entries, and by clicking on an entry view details about that item.

Recipe tracking: Users will be able to input multiple recipes/menu items and generate a list of all required ingredients.

Nutrition information: Users will be able to display nutrition information for a selected recipe/menu item.
